                    Determines what will happen when the weapon is picked up, either 'Enable' or 'Import' can be selected. Enable mode will enable a weapon matched by ID or name which is already setup on the entity picking up the weapon. Import mode
                    Will import a weapon (including the choice to also import linking abilities, groups and UI) from a linked gameobject which has the weapon setup. Depending on the configuration the import can be done directly from the linked gameobject
                    with the weapon setup or saved so the linked gameobject no longer needs to exist. Importing allows for any entity to pick up the weapon without needing to have the weapon configured in their ABC Controller.

                    The mode can be selected by clicking the dropdown and selecting the option. Depending on the option different settings appear when are detailed below.

                <p>
                    If 'Enable' is selected as the pick up mode then when an entity picks up the weapon the system will enable a weapon already setup on the entity that matches an ID or name configured. If no match can be found then no weapon will be enabled and the pick up
                    will remain until it is successfully picked up. When Enable is selected in the dropdown the following settings will appear:

                                If ticked then on pickup the system will check for a matching name on the entity enabling that weapon, this is useful if you have slightly different weapons on different characters with different ID's
                                When each character picks up the weapon it will enable their own 'sword' etc as long as the names match. If ticked a text box labelled Weapon Name will appear allowing you to enter the weapon name to match and enable.

                                If Enable Using Weapon Name is not ticked then a box will appear labelled Weapon ID allow you to put in the ID of the weapon you want to enable on the entity that picks up the weapon.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                    If 'Import' is selected as the pick up mode then when an entity picks up the weapon the system will import a weapon (including the choice to also import linking abilities, groups and UI) from a linked gameobject which has the weapon setup.
                    The linked gameobject can be setup as a 'weapon manager' which holds all weapons in your game which can be imported or this can also be setup so the weapon pick up object has it's own ABC Controller which just has the weapon you want to import.
                    There is a number of different setups you can do as long as there is an object with the weapon setup then that object can be used to import from. When Import is selected in the dropdown the following settings will appear:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                            ABC Controller Object
                            <ol>
                                Drop a gameobject on this setting which has the ABC Controller with the weapon you want to import. Once dropped a dropdown will appear next to the box with a list of weapons setup on that objects ABC Controller.
                                Once a weapon has been selected you can press the 'Update' button to link that weapon to the pickup, which will then be imported when an entity picks up the weapon. A label exists below showing which weapon
                                is currently selected to be imported
                            </ol>

                            Direct Import
                            <ol>
                                If ticked then the weapon will be imported from the linked object in real time, meaning the weapon and object needs to remain during play. If unticked then a version of the weapon selected to import is copied into the weapon pick up
                                manager, saving the data. This means that the weapon can be imported without the original object link needing to exist, however, an update will need to be redone when changes are made to the weapon linked (as the data needs to be resaved).
                                You can update the data saved by reclicking the 'Update' button.

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the weapon is picked up, the animation will
                    run for the duration defined in the settings. If the animation is shorter than the duration then the animation may repeat.

                <p>
                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                            Duration
                            <ol>
                                How long the animation clip will run for before it is stopped
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Speed
                            <ol>
                                The speed of the animation clip. 1 is normal speed. A higher value will speed up the animation clip. A lower number will slow the animation clip down.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                    run for the duration defined in the settings. If the animation is shorter than the duration then the animation may repeat.
                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity and is required for the
                    animations to activate. To determine which animation to play the “Animation Parameter”
                    which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box, then the
                    matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the
                    parameter selected the following settings will appear with default values:
                </p>
                <p>

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and
                                will just activate once as per Unity system
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                                If either of these options are selected then a On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts
                                initiating and then deactivate with the Off value after the duration set. Only a float/integer value should be entered.

                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts
                                initiating and then deactivate with the Off value after the duration set. Only “True”
                                should be entered in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.
