                   A Ability Collision Trigger has been added to GC. This allows you to trigger GC actions or GC conditions when an ABC ability collides with an object. The "On Collision With ABC Ability" trigger
                    can be found when changing the GC trigger under the "ABC Integration" section
                </p>
                <p>
                    When configuring the trigger you are able to configure 3 settings:

                             Determines the reference type of the ability, depending on the choice selected you can configure for the trigger to only activate when specific or all abilities collide. 
                            There is currently 4 reference types: "Ability Name", "Ability ID", "Effect", "All"
                            </ol>

                                If "Ability ID" is selected as the reference type then only Abilities with the matching ID placed in this box will activate the trigger on collision
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                                If "Ability Name" is selected as the reference type then only Abilities with the matching name placed in this box will activate the trigger on collision

                            Effect
                            <ol>
                                If reference type is set to "Effect" then any Abilities that collide which have the "GC Ability Collision Trigger" effect will activate the trigger. This can be further filtered down 
                                by adding a value in the "Effect Misc Value" box. If the value is empty then all Abilities with the effect will activate the trigger, else if a value is present then only Abilities with the effect 
                                and the same matching "Misc Property" value configured in the effect settings in ABC will activate the trigger. More

                    <b>(Requires GC Stats Module)</b> Functionality exists so that you can choose to use GC Health & Mana Attributes instead of ABC own Health and Mana system. If configured then ABC will instead retrieve and adjust 
                    the GC Health and/or Mana instead of it's own Health and Mana. This means that both ABC and GC functionality can be used. For example you may wish to use the ABC functionality to regen GC health/mana per second or
                    you can choose to not use this and just use GC functionality. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If ABC is set to use GC health/mana then all ABC functionality relating to health/mana will use GC Health/Mana instead. This includes adjusting health through an Ability Effect (i.e Adjust Health effect will now change GC health) or adding
                    a mana cost on abilities (which will now use GC mana)                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    To configure which system to use change the "Integration Type" setting which can be found in both the Health & Mana sections. Simply click which system to use in the dropdown, either "ABC" or "Game Creator". If Game Creator
                    is selected then an additional ID setting will appear allowing you to insert the ID of the health and mana attribute in Game Creator. This tells ABC which GC attribute represents health and mana.

                    ABC has functionality which allows for stats to affect the potency/power/force/value etc
                    behind an effect. For example with an “AdjustHealth” effect the originators
                    attack stat may modify the potency reducing more health (doing more damage)
                    however the effect may also have it’s potency modified again depending on the
                    targets defence so it doesn’t reduce as much as it would have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With GC integration you can now choose to modify the potency/power/force/value etc of an effect using Stats 
                    created in GC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To configure this select either "ABC" or "Game Creator" from the dropdown when configuring the stat modifications then simply add the ID of the GC stat in the "Stat:" text box. 
                    You can use both ABC and GameCreator stats at the same time by adding more then one stat modification to an effect
                </p>
                <p>
                    i.e if the row says "Add 100% of Originator Game Creator Stat: attack" then 100% of the GC stat value with the ID of attack will be be added to the effects potency
