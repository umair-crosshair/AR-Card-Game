                    ABC Tags is an additional tagging system similar to the tag system in Unity.
                    Both ABC tags and Unity tags are used by functionality across the system when checking against
                    certain conditions. An example of this is creating an effect that only applies to entities
                    with an “Enemy” tag. There is never the circumstance where an ABC tag will just be checked
                    over the normal Unity tag. Both are checked on every instance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no limit to the amount of ABC Tags that can be added. Clicking the “+” sign will create
                    a new text box to allow for text to be entered. You can then easily delete a tag by clicking the “x” or
                    change the ordering with the arrow keys.

                    If enabled then the entities movement can be stopped after being hit (from a correctly setup effect being applied).
                    If disabled then movement can never be stopped by a hit. If the box is ticked then the following additional settings will appear:
                </p>

                    <ul>

                            Stop Movement Duration
                            <ol>
                                A float number can be entered here to determine how long the entities movement is stopped for
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Freeze Position

                                If enabled then the entity will be frozen in place by the current transform position being frozen.
                                This is done by temporarily adding the ABC_FreezePosition script. This script works by keeping the
                                transform position the same as when the component was added and also keeping the rigidbody velocity at
                                0 if the component exists on the entity
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Disable Components
                            <ol>
                                If enabled then general unity movement components will be disabled and then re-enabled
                                after the “Stop Movement Duration”. This is done by temporarily adding the ABC_DisableMovementComponents
                                script which covers such components as navagent, character controller, rigidbody and more.
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of the above settings a delegate event will also be raised when the movement
                    is either enabled or disabled which can be connected to from any script.
                    This way any movement scripts outside of the system can execute methods when a call
                    to stop movement has been made by ABC.

                                If enabled then the entity will be frozen in place by the current transform position being frozen.
                                This is done by temporarily adding the ABC_FreezePosition script. This script works by keeping the
                                transform position the same as when the component was added and also keeping the rigidbody velocity at
                                0 if the component exists on the entity

                                If enabled then general unity movement components will be disabled and then re-enabled
                                after the “Stop Movement Duration”. This is done by temporarily adding the ABC_DisableMovementComponents
                                script which covers such components as navagent, character controller, rigidbody and more.
                            </ol>

                    On top of the above settings a delegate event will also be raised when the movement
                    is either enabled or disabled which can be connected to from any script.
                    This way any movement scripts outside of the system can execute methods when a call
                    to stop movement has been made by ABC.

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation once the entities health reaches 0.
                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity
                    and is required for the animations to activate. To determine which animation to play
                    the “Animation Parameter” which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter
                    config box, then the matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down,
                    depending on the parameter selected the following settings will appear with default values:

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and will just activate once as per Unity system

                                On Value and Off Value can be entered. The animation will activate the parameter
                                with the On value and then deactivate with the Off value after the Duration.
                                Only a float/integer value should be entered.

                                in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.

                                This setting requires a Unity Slider object which can be created from the

                                update over a duration after a delay everytime the health is reduced for an impactful effect.
                                This can be used for example to add a background colour which depletes slower than the normal
                                Health Slider (which is instant) showing how much damage the entity has just received.

                                Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                                To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                                one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                                Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:
                            </ol>

                                How long the animation clip will run for before it is stopped
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Animation Clip Speed
                            <ol>
                                The speed of the animation clip. 1 is normal speed. A higher value will speed up the animation clip. A lower number will slow the animation clip down.

                                Due to hit animations running at random times when being attacked you can choose if the hit animation clip will interrupt any animation clips currently playing. 
                                If Interrupt Current Animation is not ticked (false) then the hit animation will never interrupt another animation currently playing (like an attack).
                                If ticked (true) then the hit animation will interrupt any animation clip playing.

                                The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity and 
                                is required for the animations to activate. To determine which animation to play the “Animation Parameter” 
                                which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box, then the 
                                matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the parameter 
                                selected the following settings will appear with default values: 
                            </ol>

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and will just activate once as 
                                per Unity system 
                            </ol>

                                If either of these options are selected then a Animation Duration, 
                                On Value and Off Value can be entered. The animation will activate the 
                                parameter with the On value and then deactivate with the Off value after 
                                the Duration. Only a float/integer value should be entered.

                                and Off Value can be entered. The animation will activate the parameter with 
                                the On value and then deactivate with the Off value after the Duration. 
                                Only “True” should be entered in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.

                    Multiple Targeter Limitations can be added by pressing the “+ Add Targeter Limitation button”. 
                    The limitation config sections can also be removed by hitting the “X” or reordered with the arrow buttons. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of this is setting up limitations so a max of 3 enemies tagged as “Mages” can target 
                    the entity at once and then setting up so only 1 enemy tagged as “Melee” can target the entity at once. 
                    This stops all objects attacking the player at once creating a more fun experience.

                               If enabled then during play the system will reset the current allowed targeters 
                               every interval defined, giving other objects the chance to target the entity. 
                           </ol>

                               The tags which determine which objects will have their targeting on the 
                               entity limited depending on how many other objects with the same tag are currently targeting the entity.
                           </ol>
                           <ol>
                               Tags can be added using the “+” button, removed using the “x” button or reordered with the arrow buttons
