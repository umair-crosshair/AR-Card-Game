                    The Save Manager is ABC functionality which manages the saving and loading of ABC related data and other extras like transforms, enable states and scenes.
                    The manager is a singleton which means it can easily be accessed by other scripts. There is 2 parts to the ABC_SaveManager. One part is the component which you can setup to save and load data locally
                    or retrieve the save and load data to be placed in a Database. The other part is function calls to create and load the game data which
                    should be used if you create your own Save System. Encryption can be used throughout for security.

                    <b>
                        For the Save data to be correctly loaded it is recommend that all objects in your scene have unique names so the right data is loaded onto the right objects.
                        Any objects without unique names may be loaded incorrectly.

                <p>
                    There is a number of calls which can be made from any of your scripts to save and load your games. Detailed further in the code docs is all the function calls. Below is an example of how to call the function to save
                    and load locally using the settings set in the editor:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The below code can be written anywhere and will save the game locally to the address set in the editor: 
                    <br />
                    <code>              
                        saveManagerCont.SaveGameLocally();
                    </code>                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    To load the save configured in the editor simply write the following: 
                    <br />
                    <code>
                        saveManagerCont.LoadGameLocally();
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create a new save simply call the same function but provide a new name for the save
                    <br />
                    <code>
                        saveManagerCont.SaveGameLocally("Save3");
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To load a new save simply call the load function but provide the name of the save you wish to load. You can also pass in a second parameter if you want to only load the persistant objects
                    in the situation where your progressed to a new scene with a character you want to load data of from the save
                    <br />
                    <code>
                        saveManagerCont.NewLoadGameLocally("Save3", true/false);
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>There is also function calls to save and load the game not locally, which will return a string of the save data which you can store where you wish including in a DB. The load function will require
                the data back as a string in the parameter which you can pass through once you retrieve it from the DB</p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <p>
                    If you have created your own save system and do not want to use the settings configured in the save manager inspector then you can call functions to just grab all the data which can then be loaded back again.
                    The ABC Save Manager uses these calls itself as an example when saving/loading using the settings in its inspector. The CreateSaveData function requires a list of gameobjects to save and the cryptokey which is optional
                    to encrypt the data. If you want to grab all the ABC objects in the game to pass into this function you can use the following code:
                    <br />
                    <code>
                        ABC_Utilities.GetAllABCObjects(); 
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    An update function also exists which takes in previous save data, the objects to save and any objects to not delete from the existing save. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To load any data you have created simply call the load function passing through the data you have previously saved. 
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

                    The ABC Save Manager can save/load data locally or provide the save data in a string for you to save and retrieve from a DB. It uses settings configured in the editor to determine what to save, what data to never delete
                    and what parts to load. It will naturally save every ABC object in the current scene and also some additional information like transform, scene and enable state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can hook the Save Manager to call its function from a button press by adding a button to your game, dragging the save manager object into the OnClick box then selecting the function to call i.e SaveGameLocally

                    allowing you the files to be more secure and less easier to be tampered with. If empty then the save data/file will not be encrypted and will show all the data values. It is recommend that the file is
