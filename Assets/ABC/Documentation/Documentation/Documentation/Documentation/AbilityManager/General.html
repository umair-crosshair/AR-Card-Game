                    Only one scrollable ability can be enabled at once during play and
                    all scroll abilities will trigger with the same key/button.
                    For example during play the entity will ‘equip’/enable one of the
                    scroll abilities which can be activated with a key/button.
                    The entity can then switch to another scroll ability which is next in
                    the list ‘equipping/enabling it’ and disabling the scroll ability it switched from.
                    The newly equipped/enabled scroll ability can then be activated using the same key/button as before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be used in a game where you want to cycle weapons like an FPS.
                    All scrollable abilities will activate via one trigger.
                    Configuration to setup what key will activate the current equipped
                    scroll ability and cycle to the next and previous scroll ability can
                    be done in the ABC Controller settings. More information on setting up ability scroll triggers
                    can be found by clicking the following link:
                    <a onclick="HyperLink('ControllerConfig', 'Settings', 'HeaderScrollable_AND_Reload', 'Overview')">Scrollable & Reload Triggers</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Setup can also be done to enable a group of abilities once a
                    specific scroll ability becomes enabled/’equipped’.
                    This can be used to setup a weapon system where equipping a hammer
                    will enable certain melee abilities, whilst then switching to a sword
                    will enable other melee abilities etc. More information on setting up ability groups

                <p>
                    Only useable If ability has been set up as a “Scroll Ability”.
                    More information on scroll abilities can be found by clicking the following link:
                    <a href="#Scroll_Ability">Scroll Abilities Overview</a>.
                    If enabled then the abilities ammo will be divided into ‘clip sizes’ which determines how many
                    times the ability can activate before a reload is required. Everytime the clip count reaches
                    0 the ability will require a trigger to be pressed to ‘reload’ filling up the clip.
                    When the clip count reaches 0 The ability can’t be activated again until the reload has
                    filled the the clip (if possible, if ability only has 6 ammo remaining and clip size is 10
                    it will only fill clip up to 6).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clip can also be reloaded early discarding the current clip count but
                    filling the clip to full ready for an upcoming battle.
                    Although named after gun mechanics this in theory isn’t a setting just for guns.
                    You may create an energy ability which has 100 shots and after 10 ‘shots’
                    (clip size being 10) the entity will need to recharge his energy with a click of a button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reloading will be cancelled If the scroll ability is disabled/unequipped due to the
                    entity swapping to another scroll ability.
                    Once the scroll ability is re-equipped/re-enabled then it can once again be reloaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of use: Ability has an ammo count of 100 and a clip size of 10. After 10 shots,
                    the ability will require a trigger to be pressed to reload,
                    filling the clip back up to 10 and reducing the ammo count by 10.

                    A dropdown selection of either 'Input' or 'Input Combo' can be entered. Depending on the selection the ability can trigger from one or two ways:
                </p>

                                If Input is selected the ability will trigger from a single key press - once selected additional fields will be displayed to allow for you to select
                                the key or button required to trigger the ability. Additional key setting will also appear in the circumstance you want 2 keys to trigger the ability for example
                                trigger the ability when Shift is held down and the mouse is clicked (for like a dash attack)
                            </ol>

                            Input Combo
                            <ol>
                                If selected then a combination of keys can be setup to trigger the ability i.e F > F > B if inputted will trigger the special attack.
                                Once selected then an additional list box will appear below allowing you to configure which key combination needs to be pressed to trigger the ability.
                                Pressing the '+' will add another key which is required to be pressed. Pressing the up and down arrows will change the order of the inputs. The order from top
                                to bottom determines the order the keys need to be pressed to trigger the ability. The recorded inputs will recycle by an interval by a global setting described
                                in the following link:  <a onclick="HyperLink('ControllerConfig', 'Settings', 'HeaderGeneral_&_Error', 'Input_Combo_Recycle_Interval')">Input Combo Recycle Interval</a>               
                                For example if the interval is set to 1, if F > F is entered then the player has 1 second to enter the B to do the special attack, if done after
                                the interval the ability will not trigger and the player has to enter in again F > F > B.

                    If you want the entity to restart the combo quickly after
                    just finishing the previous combo then keep this setting low for
                    the last ability so it will reset the combo quicker.

                            If both abilities have animations setup then
                            these would need to be accurately timed not to conflict with each other.)

                <p>
                    All linked abilities will activate as if they were activated through
                    normal means using all settings configured for them, if linked abilities
                    have different animations setup this may cause a few unexpected results
                    so it’s recommended all animations are setup on the master ability unless timings are done right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ability Activation Links provides a whole range of different possibilities

                    You can also play with different settings like preparation times
                    which will mean that abilities don’t appear in game at the same
                    time but one after another etc. Linked abilities can have their own linked abilities and so fourth.

                    Once enabled the Activation Link list box will appear.

                    ability in the dropdown next to the “Activate Links” label and
                    then pressing the “+” button. The ability can be removed from the
                    activation link list by hitting the “X” button at the end of the
                    row of each ability. Abilities can be ordered using the up and down
                    arrows at the end of the row of each ability. Once the master ability
                    activates it will then activate the linked abilities in order of the list.

                <p>
                    In this section effects can be setup which will be applied to other 
                    objects which have the ABC StateManager component. 
                    Effects are applied from ability hits/collisions.
                     Effects will be inflicted one by one to the entity in the order that 
                    they appear in this section, effects can be reordered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each effect is uniquely attached to the ability and can only be added to an 
                    entity if they do not already have the same effect from the same 
                    ability applied on them (unless the effect has the “Allow Duplicate Effect Activation” setting enabled). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: an entity has a Fireball ability and a Lightning ability and both 
                    abilities have a Adjust Health effect setup. 
                    Even though the 2 effects do the same thing they are unique and not related. 
                    If the entity activates 2 Fireball abilities and 1 Lightning ability 
                    and all abilities hits the enemy at the exact same time then the enemy
                     will be inflicted with the Adjust Health effect from the Lightning and 1 Fireball ability. 
                    The effect from the second fireball ability will not be applied as the 
                    enemy would already have the Fireball effect active on him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each effect has a number of settings and graphics which 
                    can play out which provide a number of customisable possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>

                    This setting if enabled will allow for the ability to set up ability effect links. 
                    Any abilities linked will have all their effects applied on any ABC StateManager 
                    objects hit by the master ability (which is currently being configured). 
                    The master ability will also add its own effects if they have been setup. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example if 2 abilities are created Fireball and Lightning. 
                    You can have a Adjust Health effect setup on the lightning ability. 
                    If you then configured the Fireball ability and added Lightning as an effect link, 
                    then every time the Fireball hits an object it will apply all effects setup for 
                    the Lightning ability. The same rules apply regarding not being able to apply 
                    the same effect from the same ability on an entity who already has the effect 
                    active on them (unless the effect has the “Allow Duplicate Effect Activation” setting enabled). 
                    The effect will just act as if the Lightning applied the effect and 
                    will not act any different just because it was applied through being linked to the Fireball ability. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be useful if you want to set out certain effects which you may want to 
                    change once but be applied to a number of abilities. 
                    You are more than free to create an ‘effect abilities’ 
                    which will never be activated in game but just hosts effects which are linked to by other abilities.

                    The ability can be removed from the effect link list by hitting the “X” 
                    button at the end of the row of each ability. Abilities can be ordered 
                    using the up and down arrows at the end of the row of each ability. 
                    The linked ability effects will be applied one by one by in order of the list.

                    How long the effect will be active for before it’s removed from the entity. 
                    The same effect from the same ability can not be reapplied if the effect is 
                    currently active on the entity (unless the effect has the

                    Recommend effect duration is kept low if an ability is

                    If an ability effect like a stat enhancement has been applied then you
                    might want a greater duration so the same stat enhancement effect can’t be

                    then ensures that the player can’t keep activating the ability for really high stats.

                    Stats can be created in the ABC StateManager configuration, for information on setting up stats please click the following link:

                    This settings allows for entities stats to affect the power/force/value etc 
                    behind an effect. For example with an “AdjustHealth” effect the originators 
                    attack stat may modify the potency reducing more health (doing more damage) 
                    however the effect may also have it’s potency modified again depending on the 
                    targets defence so it doesn’t reduce as much as it would have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Details on what potency does for each effect can be found by clicking the following link:

                    removed from the list by hitting the “X” button at the end of the row. 
                    Modifications can be ordered using the up and down arrows at the end of

                <p>
                    Starting Potency -100 (reduce health by 100 as a base)

                <p>
                    Modification 1: Minus 30% of Originators Attack (100)

                    is then increased by 100% of the entity defence making it -110 
                    adjusted health i.e 110 damage the target will receive.

                    the entity taking damage every 2 seconds for a 10 second period during 
                    play this can simulate a burn effect from a fireball ability or a 
                    poison infliction from another ability.

                                Tag on the specific gameobject which was hit by the 
                                ability which doesn’t necessarily have the ABC StateManager 
                                component but is a child object of the entity which does 
                                have the component. if a tag matches any Effect Required 
                                Tags set then the effect will be applied on the entity, 
                                if no tags match then the effect will not be applied.

                <p>
                    There is no limit to the amount of  Effect Required Tags that can be added. 
                    Clicking the “+” sign will create a new text box to allow for text to be entered. 
                    You can then delete a tag by clicking the “x” or change the ordering with the arrow keys. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An example of a use for this functionality can be for FPS games and headshots. 
                    You can tag each head child object on an entity as “Headshot” 
                    then create an effect which does more damage if the object hit has a “Headshot” tag. 
                    If the head is not hit then the headshot more damage effect will not be applied. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also have an ability with an effect setup with a random chance to add 
                    a temporary tag, then another effect which will do extra damage if that specific 
                    tag exists allowing for random Critical Strike attacks etc.

                    Surrounding Objects will become attached to the ability, travelling along side it. 
                    Once the ability is destroyed all surrounding objects will be converted
