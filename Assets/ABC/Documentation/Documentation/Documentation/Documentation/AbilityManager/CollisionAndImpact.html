                    This section of the editor determines if a collider should be added to the ability, the collider can be added through different ways like a time delay 
                    or after a input trigger. You can also determine the radius and how it collides (on enter, on stay etc). If you rather use your own collider then this can
                    be disabled

                    Any colliders already present on the ability (through the graphic object) will remain.
                    If enabled then a collider will be added inheriting the settings defined below.

                                The potency behind uplift force, the greater the value the bigger the up force applied, lifting entities into the air.

                            <ol>
                                Will only apply the splash explosion to entities that have a ABC/Unity tag that matches one of the tags defined in the list box. 
                                For example if you only want a certain entity to have explosive force applied from the ability then add one of that entities tags into the list box provided.
                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                Clicking the “+” sign will create a new text box to allow for Tags to be entered. 
                                You can then delete a tag by clicking the “x” or change the ordering with the arrow keys. Both ABC and Unity tagging systems are used when trying to match Tags.
