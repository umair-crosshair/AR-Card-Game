                    If ticked then graphics and animations can be setup to activate whilst the ability is preparing
                    (after being activated). The abilities prepare time can be determined in the General tab under
                    Settings. More details can be found
                    by clicking the following link: <a onclick="HyperLink('AbilityManager', 'General', 'HeaderSettings', 'Prepare_Time')">Ability Prepare Time</a>.

                    once the prepare time is over the ability will initiate.
                    An example of use is adding animation and graphics which make the entity look like they
                    are conjuring a spell. Once enabled further settings will appear to setup the animations and graphics etc.

                    Animation Clips defined
                    will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                                If ticked then the animation clip will run on the entity that the ABC component is on.

                    the animation will repeat until the ability preparation stage is over. The animation
                    system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity
                    and is required for the animations to activate. To determine which animation to
                    play the “Animation Parameter” which has been setup in Unity needs to be written
                    in the parameter config box, then the matching parameter type needs to be selected

                                If either of these options are selected then a On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts

                                If ticked then the entity will have movement stopped due to a transform position freeze.
                                This will add the ABC_FreezePosition component to the entity.
                                This works by ensuring the entity always remains at the position they was at when the component was added.

                                This will add the ABC_DisableMovementComponents script  to the entity. This works by disabling
                                common movement scripts including: CharacterController and NavMeshAgent. The rigidbody is also halted by making sure the velocity is always at 0.

                    If enabled then the entity will move to the ability target during preparing.
                    If the ability doesn't use targets (Forward Travel Type etc) then the entity will move towards the current target
                    or soft target.

                    Once ticked the below settings will appear allowing you to modify the delay before the entity starts moving to the target
                    and how long it takes to reach the target. You can also define an offset to the target position and a stop distance which determines
                    the position to which the entity will move to (for example slightly above the target stopping a certain distance infront)

                                X, Y, Z float values can be entered which will set the new destination in relation to the ability targets current position.
                                The destination is where the entity will be moved too gradually, reaching the final position after a duration.
                                I.e if a value is entered in the Y box then the entity will travel to a point above the target
                                reaching a point determined by the value provided.

                                A float value can be entered here which will make the entity move to a position infront or behind the target depending on the forward offset value
                                The entity will reach the new forward position gradually once the ability starts preparing,
                                reaching the destination after a duration. If negative value is entered the entity will move to a position behind the target

                                The entity will reach the new right position gradually once the ability starts preparing, reaching
                                the destination after a duration.  If negative value is entered the entity will move to a position to the left or right of the target

                                The stop distance will determine how far from the target position the entity will stop. The entity will stop moving towards the target when the distance from the target position is reached.
                                At 0 the entity will move to the exact target position, setting a value of 5 will make the entity stop a little distance before the target position. The higher the number the further away from the target
                                the entity will stop.

                    before being released to enemies below. The system will stop the entity from falling by stopping any rigidbody

                    An example of use is adding animation and graphics which will position the entities hand ready for the

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                    If enabled then the entity will move to the ability target when initiating.
                    If the ability doesn't use targets (Forward Travel Type etc) then the entity will move towards the current target
                    or soft target.

                    Once ticked the below settings will appear allowing you to modify the delay before the entity starts moving to the target
                    and how long it takes to reach the target. You can also define an offset to the target position and a stop distance which determines
                    the position to which the entity will move to (for example slightly above the target stopping a certain distance infront)

                                X, Y, Z float values can be entered which will set the new destination in relation to the ability targets current position.
                                The destination is where the entity will be moved too gradually, reaching the final position after a duration.
                                I.e if a value is entered in the Y box then the entity will travel to a point above the target
                                reaching a point determined by the value provided.

                                The entity will reach the new forward position gradually once the ability starts initiating,
                                reaching the destination after a duration. If negative value is entered the entity will move to a position behind the target

                                The entity will reach the new right position gradually once the ability starts initiating, reaching
                                the destination after a duration.  If negative value is entered the entity will move to a position to the left or right of the target

                                The stop distance will determine how far from the target position the entity will stop. The entity will stop moving towards the target when the distance from the target position is reached.
                                At 0 the entity will move to the exact target position, setting a value of 5 will make the entity stop a little distance before the target position. The higher the number the further away from the target
                                the entity will stop.

                    If enabled then the activating entity will defy gravity for a duration when the ability starts initiating,
                    essentially making the entity float for a set time. This for example can be used for melee abilities
                    which are activated in the air, keeping the entity a float for a small duration to finish the attack.
                    The system will stop the entity from falling by stopping any rigidbody velocity then turning off the

                    If ticked then graphics can be setup to activate whenever the ability is destroyed and disabled.
                    The ability can be destroyed due to the duration being up or from colliding with another entity
                    depending on collision configuration set. The graphic will activate at the position the ability was destroyed.
                    An example of use is adding an explosion effect whenever a fireball is destroyed.

                    Unless a duration greater than 0 has been set the  graphic will be destroyed at the end of the preparation stage just before the ability initiates.
                    This graphic does not interact with anything and is only useful for preparation aesthetic purposes. For example an ability can be setup so at the
                    preparation stage the entity will summon down a lightning strike from the sky to their hand before they then send it off in the direction of enemies.

                    This can also be used for games similar to Skyrim, where you scroll through to new abilities showing a graphic which represents
                    what type of ability will initiate when the scroll ability share key/button trigger is pressed.

                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>

                            Trigger Parameter
                            <ol>
                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and will just activate once as per Unity system
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                            Float, Integer Parameter
                            <ol>
                                If either of these options are selected then a On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On
                                value when the scroll ability is is disabled/‘unequipped’ and then deactivate with the Off
                                value after the duration set. Only a float/integer value should be entered.
                            </ol>

                            Bool Parameter

                                If either of these options are selected then a On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the scroll ability is
                                disabled/‘unequipped’ and then deactivate with the Off value after the duration set.
                                Only “True” should be entered in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the ability reloads. The animation will run for the duration of the reload.
                    The reload duration is defined in the General tab under Settings. Further information on setting the reload duration
                    can be found by clicking the following link:

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                                If ticked then the animation clip will run on the entity that the ABC component is on.

                                If ticked then the animation clip will run on the current scroll abilities graphic (if it exists).
                                This setting should be ticked if the current scroll ability graphic object has its own reloading animation you want to play.

                                This setting should be ticked if the current weapon has its own animation you want to play.

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the ability reloads. The animation will run  for the duration of the reload.
                    The reload duration is defined in the General tab under Settings. further information on setting the reload duration
                    can be found by clicking the following link:

                <p>
                    If “Reload Fill Clip” is enabled then the animation will keep running whilst the clip is filled one by one (using the duration as an interval).
                    In this scenario It's recommended to time how long it takes for the animation to play out once and use that for the reload duration as this will then
                    flow nicely with the clip being filled up by 1 after each loop of the animation.

                    Further information on setting "Reload Fill Clip" can be found by clicking the following link:

                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity and is required for the animations to activate.
                    To determine which animation to play the “Animation Parameter” which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box,
                    then the matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the parameter selected the following settings will appear with default values:

                </p>

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and
                                will just activate once as per Unity system

                                If either of these options are selected then a On Value and Off Value can be entered. The animation will
                                activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts reloading and
                                then deactivate with the Off value after the reload ends. Only a float/integer value should be entered.
                            </ol>

                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts reloading and then
                                deactivate with the Off value after the reload ends. Only “True” should be entered in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.
