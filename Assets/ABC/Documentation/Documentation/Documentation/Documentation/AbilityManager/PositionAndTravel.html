                                travelling towards the selected target. I.e an ability can be setup to travel up
                                from the starting position into the air for 3 seconds before it then starts
                                travelling back down to the target.

                                and a “Range Less Than” box will appear to set the range.

                                start travelling towards the targets current position but will always keep going in that
                                direction no matter if the target moves.

                                is nothing stopping the user from selecting the same object the entity is already targeting.

                                If a negative value is entered it will modify the ability target position to a point to the left of the entities
                                current position rather than to the right.

                                A target/world target position selection is required even if the entity
                                already has a target/world target position although there is nothing
                                stopping the user from selecting the same object/position the entity is already targeting.

                                If enabled then the ability can only be activated if the entity is within a certain range of the
                                selected world target position. When ticked a “Range Greater Than” and a “Range Less Than” box
                                will appear to set the range.

                            <ol>
                                For example if 5 is added to the greater than box and 15 is added to the less than box then the
                                entities distance has to be further then 5 from the world target position but less then 15 for the ability to activate.

                                If ticked then the ability will continuously travel to the world target position, like a homing missile.
                                If disabled then the projectile will start travelling towards the world target position but will
                                always keep going in that direction no matter if the target moves.

                                If ticked then the ability will wait for a world target to be selected before activating.
                                A world target selection is required even if the entity already has a world position target
                                set although there is nothing stopping the user from selecting the same position the entity is already targeting.

                            <ol>

                                down the raycast line (defined by the “Returned Distance” setting above). The ability will then travel towards this point.

                                If ticked then the raycast sent towards the crosshair center to find the ability destination point will be recorded when the ability first activates (before preparing etc).

                    The ability will travel towards a random entity with a specific ABC/Unity tag.
                    Entities are checked for a matching tag within a defined range of the ability starting position.
                    If selected the following settings appear:

                            Travel Physics
                            <ol>
                                Velocity or Force can be selected from the dropdown. Velocity will move the ability at a constant speed.
                                Force will move the ability increasing speed over time.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                                X, Y, Z float values can be entered which will change the abilities destination so that it will travel towards the selected entities
                                position + the offset (so the destination will be slightly above/below/to the side of the selected entities position depending on the values set).
                                i.e 5 in the Y box will make the ability move towards the entities current position + 5 in the Y Axis, which should make the ability aim slightly
                                higher then the selected entities transform position. This can be used to make the ability hit at the targets feet for example rather than in the chest.

                                A float value can be entered here which will change the abilities destination so that it will travel towards the selected entities
                                position + the forward offset (so the destination will be slightly forward or behind the selected entities position depending
                                on the value set). If a negative value is entered it will modify the ability destination position to a point
                                behind the selected entities current position rather than forwards.

                            <ol>
                                A float value can be entered here which will change the abilities destination so that it will travel towards
                                the selected entities position + the right offset (so the destination will be slightly to the left or to the
                                right of the entities position depending on the value set). If a negative value is entered it will modify the
                                ability destination position to a point to the left of the entities current position rather than to the right.

                                If ticked then the ability has the potential to miss the target depending on the originators miss chance and values
                                else if unticked it will never take the miss chance into account and always go to the position it was meant to. If missing the ability will
                                offsetting randomly on to the position it was intended to go to. More information regarding the miss chance setting can be found here:

                                If disabled then the ability will instantly appear at the selected entities position and will not travel from it’s starting position.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                                If a value over 0 is entered then the ability will travel forward in a straight line in its starting direction until the
                                delay is over in which it will then start travelling towards the selected entities position. I.e an ability can be setup
                                to travel up from the starting position into the air for 3 seconds before it then starts travelling back down to the selected entity.

                                If ticked then the entity will turn to face the selected entity with the matching tag when activating the ability.

                                If enabled then the entity activating the ability must be facing the selected entity with the matching tag  to activate the ability.

                                If ticked then the ability will continuously travel to the selected entities current position even if the entity moves, like a homing missile.
                                If disabled then the projectile will start travelling towards the selected entities current position but will always keep going in that
                                direction no matter if the entity moves.
                            </ol>

                            Affect Only Target
                            <ol>
                                If enabled then the ability will only collide and apply effects to the selected entity with the matching tag, ignoring all other objects on the way.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                            Always Travel
                            <ol>
                                If ticked then the ability will activate and travel in a straight line in the situation that no entity has been found with a matching tag.
                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                If disabled then the ability will not activate if no entity is found with a matching tag.

                            <ol>
                                The travel will act as if the travel type was set to Forward, i.e the ability will have the travel speed
                                defined in settings applied to the objects forward transform

                                If enabled then the activating entity is not considered when the ability is searching for an object to travel too that matches a tag defined.

                                The ability will travel towards an entity found with a matching tag.

                    The travel type will default to Melee if the ability type is set to “Melee”.  Melee abilities do not travel as they become a 
                    child of the starting position object, allowing for animations to control the movement of the ability (like a sword swipe). 
                    However additional settings can still be set which change the behaviour behind the melee attack (i.e is a selected target 
                    required to activate the melee attack, if yes then does the entity rotate towards the target on activation) etc.

                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                If disabled then the ability will not activate if the entity does not currently have a target/soft target selected.

                                activation has finished i.e rotation will occur until the ability is disabled and the melee attack has finished

                                If enabled and the entity currently has no selected target then the melee ability will as a backup 
                                treat the entities current Soft Target as the selected target.

                                For example if 1 is added to the greater than box and 7 is added to the less than box then the entities distance has to

                                If “Always Activate” is enabled then the range is only considered if the entity currently has a target/soft target. If the entity has no 
                                target and “Always Activate” is ticked then the ability will activate until a target has been selected in which the range will be checked again.

                                If enabled then the entity must be facing the target/soft target to activate the ability.

                                If “Always Activate” is enabled then the facing target requirement is only considered if the entity currently 
                                has a target/soft target. If the entity has no target and “Always Activate” is ticked then the ability will

                                i.e 5 in the Y box will make the ability move towards the bounce target position + 5 in the Y Axis, which should make the ability aim slightly higher
                                than the world target position. This can be used to make the ability hit at the entities feet for example rather than in the chest.

                                “Nearest Tag” will have the ability bounce between objects within range that has an ABC/Unity tag that matches one of the tags specified. 
                                If this option is selected a new “Bounce Tag” section will appear. Clicking the “+” sign will create a new text box to allow
