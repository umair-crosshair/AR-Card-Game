                    This part of the system allows for the setup of Weapons. Weapons can be equipped/uneqipped and cycled through during play. Each weapon
                    can be configured to have 1 or more graphics which can then be placed in different positions when equipped and unequipped. For example
                    a Sword graphic can be setup to be in the entities hand when equipped and on his back when unequipped. For equipping/unequipped weapons
                    animations can be added.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Other functionality includes linking weapons to abilities and groups. By doing this you can set to enable/disable abilities/groups when the weapon
                    is equipped. For example during play when the entity equips the sword weapon then all the sword related attacks and abilities will be enabled ready to use
                    whilst all other abilities will be disabled. Weapons can also be assigned to groups which will enable the weapon ready to be equipped when a certain group
                    is activated (i.e in fire mode allow for fire weapons to be equipped)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last group of settings in this section determines weapon dropping functionality. You can set if the weapon can be dropped and what happens when doing so
                    i.e disable/delete the relating abilities/groups/ui. An animation can also be setup to play when dropping a weapon and a weapon drop object can be added
                    which will drop an object when the weapon is 'dropped' in the system. It's recommended that the weapon drop object has the weapon pick up component which
                    allows for other players to pick up the weapon. More information on this is found by clicking the following link:

                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.

                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.

                    If enabled then the weapons ammo will be divided into ‘clip sizes’ which determines how many
                    times the weapon through abilities can activate before a reload is required. Everytime the clip count reaches
                    0 the weapon will require a trigger to be pressed to ‘reload’ filling up the clip.
                    When the clip count reaches 0 The abilities using the weapon can’t activate again until the reload has
                    filled the the clip (if possible, if weapon only has 6 ammo remaining and clip size is 10
                    it will only fill clip up to 6).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The clip can also be reloaded early discarding the current clip count but
                    filling the clip to full ready for an upcoming battle.
                    Although named after gun mechanics this in theory isn’t a setting just for guns.
                    You may create an energy ability which has 100 shots and after 10 ‘shots’
                    (clip size being 10) the entity will need to recharge his energy with a click of a button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reloading will be cancelled If the weapon is disabled/unequipped due to the
                    entity swapping to another weapon.
                    Once the weapon is re-equipped/re-enabled then it can once again be reloaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of use: Weapon has an ammo count of 100 and a clip size of 10. After 10 shots used by an ability,
                    the weapon will require a trigger to be pressed to reload,
                    filling the clip back up to 10 and reducing the ammo count by 10.

                <p>
                    Animations and Graphics which activate on reload can be setup with the settings defined below.

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                    Within this sction you can link weapon to abilities to have the abilities either enable or disable when the weapon is equipped. You can also link
                    the weapon to groups so the weapon is enabled when a group is enabled. On the flip side you can also enable or disable groups when the weapon is equipped.
                    All these options allow you to control in game which abilities can be used when weapons are equipped. It is good practice to only have abilities
                    enabled which relate to the weapon disabling the rest. For groups you can set it up so certain weapons are only avaliable when a group is activated like a special fire mode etc

                    Within this sction you can define settings which will allow for your entity to drop the weapon. When dropped you can choose for the weapon
                    to be disabled or deleted. You can also set for the linking enable abilities, groups and UI to also be disabled/deleted. Animations can run when
                    dropping the weapon and you can define for a weapon drop object to appear in game. The weapon drop object can be any GameObject but it's recommended
                    to have an object which has the ABC_WeaponPickUp component attached if you want any entities to pick up the weapon again. More information on
                    the pickup component can be found by clicking the following link:

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the weapon is Dropped, the animation will

                <p>
                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:
                </p>
                <p>

                                How long the animation clip will run for before it is stopped

                                The speed of the animation clip. 1 is normal speed. A higher value will speed up the animation clip. A lower number will slow the animation clip down.

                    run for the duration defined in the settings. If the animation is shorter than the duration then the animation may repeat.
                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity and is required for the
                    animations to activate. To determine which animation to play the “Animation Parameter”
                    which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box, then the
                    matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the
                    parameter selected the following settings will appear with default values:

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and
                                will just activate once as per Unity system

                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value when the ability starts
                                initiating and then deactivate with the Off value after the duration set. Only a float/integer value should be entered.
