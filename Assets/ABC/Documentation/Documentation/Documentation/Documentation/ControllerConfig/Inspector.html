                    ABC Controller is required for creating and activating abilities, targetting objects, managing AI, ability grouping and more. The component once attached can open up 2 editor windows for more config. There
                    is also additional settings in the inspector window which are detailed below.

                    If enabled then the configuration window will update when the window isn’t in focus. This will decrease performance
                    but is useful to use when checking for value/setting changes during play (as the values will update without having to
                    keep clicking the configuration window). If disabled then the window will update whilst it is focused.

                    placed in a “pool” increasing performance (as no objects will be instantiated during play). Pressing this button
                    will clear the object pool and regenerate the objects.
                    This button should be pressed if any object/graphic settings are changed during play otherwise the old objects will still be used.
                    More information on pooling can be found.

                    This section allows for the import of abilities from other ABC Controller entities, 
                    essentially copying abilities from one entity to another. When abilities are exported a scriptable object is created. 
                    Adding an exported scriptable object file to the “Import Object” field and pressing the “Import” button will import all the chosen 
                    abilities to the entity.

                    More information on exporting abilities and creating scriptable objects can be found by clicking the following link:
