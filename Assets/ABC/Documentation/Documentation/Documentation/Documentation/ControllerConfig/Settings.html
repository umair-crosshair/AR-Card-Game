                    the smaller the number the faster the entity can activate abilities one after another. The setting can take a float value.

                    100% means all abilities will prepare at the normal rate defined for each ability. If for example the

                    This setting requires a Unity text object which can be created from the Unity menu: GameObject > UI >Text.
                    This object can be placed anywhere on the screen and will display the key/button that will trigger the icon
                    activating the ability/current scroll ability. The ability trigger settings can be found here: <a onclick="HyperLink('ControllerConfig', 'Settings', 'HeaderScrollable_AND_Reload', 'Activate_Input_Type')">Activate Input Type</a>.
                    More information on scroll abilities can be found here: <a onclick="HyperLink('AbilityManager', 'General', 'HeaderSettings', 'Scroll Ability')">Scroll Abilities</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The text setting can always be configured even if the Icon is an empty type. This is for
                    during play for when the icon potentially gets converted into another type due to another icon being dropped on it.
