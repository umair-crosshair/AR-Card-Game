                    AI can be setup which will make the entity automatically perform actions in game like
                    activating an ability or activating an ability group. For each AI Rule conditions can be
                    created which will determine if the entity should automatically perform the action or not.
                    For example a rule could be setup to activate a heal ability on objects with a certain tag when
                    their HP is below 50%. Other conditions also include probability rolls for randomness.

                    Probability rolls are still checked. If disabled then the AI rule as normal only activate after it finds nearby potential targets. 
                    Useful to use if you want to create a 'pickup' ability which will appear throughout the scene.

                    retaliation attack on the “Ally” objects targets essentially making the entity attack the enemy which just hit the ally.
