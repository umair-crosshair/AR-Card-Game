                    Configuration below will enable the entity to target other entities in game. Abilities can track targetted abilities but other functionality is also linked to targetting
                    like showing health/mana on target. There is different types of targetting avaliable from hovering to clicking.

                    The select type determines how the system can record the target and world target position.
                    3 options can be selected: None, Mouse or Crosshair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If mouse is selected then the target will be recorded using the mouse position i.e what
                    gameobject the mouse is hovering over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If Crosshair is selected then the target will be recorded by sending a raycast through the crosshair
                    position i.e what gameobject the crosshair is hovering over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If none is selected then the target can not be retrieved from clicking/hovering with the mouse/crosshair.
                    If no ABC objects are picked up from the selection then any object hit is recorded as a world target.

                    else it will run every interval defined. The higher the interval number the greater the performance,
                    however the higher the number the less likely the system will pick up a ‘click’ from the user so
                    target selection will not be as responsive.

                    will also be deselected. This also determines the max range for auto targeting. More information on auto targetting can be found
                    by clicking the following link:

                                or a button string which links to the same string setup in the Unity Input Manager.
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                                A key can be selected from Unity’s predefined drop down to trigger the click for target selection. This key is hardcoded.

                                A string can be entered which should match the same string setup in the Unity Input Manager.
                                This method allows the end user to configure inputs as per Unity functionality to trigger the click for target selection.

                    If true then soft target status will always be applied instead of the object becoming a main target.
                    Soft target is a secondary target type and acts primarily as a pre-target status. The entity can have both a target and a soft target.
                    Although the target will always take priority over the soft target. Configuration can be setup for the system to convert
                    the soft target into the main current target on input. Abilities can also be setup to target the soft target as a backup if
                    the main target has not yet been selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be used for example to switch targets during play, whilst the entity has a main target set
                    in game you can show a graphic and toggle through ‘soft targets’ with an input to confirm the new target.

                    is less accurate (leeway) to hopefully pick up any objects near the mouse/crosshair. This gives a the player more of a
                    chance to select a target.

                    Soft target is a secondary target type and acts primarily as a pre-target status.
                    The entity can have both a target and a soft target. Although the target will always take priority over the soft target.
                    Configuration can be setup for the system to convert the soft target into the main current target on input.

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                                This setting should be ticked if the current scroll ability graphic object has its own crosshair override animation you want to play.
                                For example a gun/arm model with an  animation to bring it to the characters
                                eye as a focus at the same time the crosshair override appears.

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the crosshair override is present.
                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the entity
                    and is required for the animations to activate. To determine which animation to play the “Animation Parameter”
                    which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box, then the matching parameter
                    type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the parameter selected the following settings
                    will appear with default values:

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and will just activate once as per Unity system

                                If either of these options are selected then a Animation Duration, On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value and then deactivate with the Off value after
                                the Duration. Only a float/integer value should be entered.
