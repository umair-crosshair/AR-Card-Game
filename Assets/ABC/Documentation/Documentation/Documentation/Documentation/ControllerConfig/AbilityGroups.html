                    This part of the system allows for the setup of ABC groups. Abilities can be assigned to groups which have been created, more information on assigning
                    abilities to groups can be found by clicking the following link: <a onclick="HyperLink('AbilityManager', 'General', 'HeaderSettings', 'Allow_Group_Assignment')">Allow Group Assignment</a>
                    During play different events can be setup which will enable or disable all abilities
                    assigned to an ability group. Weapons can also be set to be equipped when the group is enabled or disabled
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example; An ability group ‘Fire Mode’ can be created and all fire related abilities can be assigned to this group.
                    During play it can be setup so whenever the user presses a key/button then it will activate the Fire Mode group,
                    enabling all the fire related abilities ready to be used in game. There is more ways to initiate the enable/disable
                    of a group then just key input including a points system and a way to enable/disable a group when a scroll
                    ability becomes active ‘equipped’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the best way to link together multiple abilities under one group allowing for them all to be enabled/disabled
                    at the same time after a certain defined event depending on options ticked in the groups configuration.

                    exists then the ability group can be setup to be enabled when the gun is enabled/‘equipped’ and also setup to be
                    disabled when the gun is disabled/‘unequipped’. More information on scroll abilities can be found by clicking the following link:

                    Ability groups can be linked to scroll abilities via the drop down in this section next to the ‘Scroll Ability’ label.
                    Once a scroll ability has been selected in the drop down the “+” can be selected to add it to the list.
                    The ‘X’ can be pressed next to any scroll ability in the list to remove it. There is no limit to how many
                    scroll abilities you can link to the ability group.

                    An example of use for this functionality is having a particle show all over the entities body after a short

                    Animation Clips defined will play on ABC's own Animation Runner system which means you can set to run animations without using Unity's Animator.
                    To determine which animation to play simply select or drag and drop an Animation Clip into the setting. With all animations in ABC you have the option of using
                    one or both of the animation systems (Unity Animator/ABC Animation Runner). It is recommended however that only one is used.
                    Once an Animation Clip is selected the following settings will appear:

                                The speed of the animation clip. 1 is normal speed. A higher value will speed up the animation clip. A lower number will slow the animation clip down.

                    Configuration can be setup to play an animation when the ability group is enabled.
                    The animation system links directly into the Unity animation controller attached to the
                    entity and is required for the animations to activate. To determine which animation to play the
                    “Animation Parameter” which has been setup in Unity needs to be written in the parameter config box,
                    then the matching parameter type needs to be selected from the drop down, depending on the parameter
                    selected the following settings will appear with default values:

                                No further settings will appear as the animation type is a trigger and will just activate once as per Unity system

                                If either of these options are selected then a Animation Duration, On Value and Off Value can be entered.
                                The animation will activate the parameter with the On value and then deactivate with the Off value after the Duration.
                                Only a float/integer value should be entered.

                                Duration. Only “True” should be entered in the On value and “False” entered in the off value.
